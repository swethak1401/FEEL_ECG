This repository contains a complete Python implementation of the paper "FEEL-ECG: Federated Edge Learning for Personalized and Explainable ECG Monitoring with Adaptive Compression and Preprocessing". It reproduces the core framework for building a lightweight, private, and interpretable model for real-time arrhythmia detection on edge devices.

📊 Visualizations & Results
To make the results more tangible and believable, this section showcases key visual outputs from the model, as described in the paper.

Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix below demonstrates the model's high accuracy across all five AAMI classes on the test set. The strong diagonal indicates minimal misclassifications.

Saliency Map Explainability (XAI)
The embedded explainability module generates saliency maps that highlight which parts of the ECG waveform were most influential in the model's prediction. This aligns with clinical interpretability.

✨ Key Features
🔬 Data Preprocessing: Automated download and processing of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database using R-peak detection and AAMI standard labeling.

✂️ Hybrid Compression: A three-stage pipeline including architectural compression, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), and structured pruning.

🌐 Federated Learning: A simulation of Motif-Aware Federated Averaging (MA-FedAvg) with differential privacy to protect user data.

💡 Edge-Ready Model: Generates a final, highly compressed .tflite model ready for deployment on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pi.

⚡ On-Device Simulation: Includes a script to simulate inference, explainability, and energy-efficient duty cycling on an edge device.

🏗️ System Architecture
The FEEL-ECG framework follows a multi-stage pipeline from raw data to an explainable on-device prediction.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Git

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/FEEL-ECG-Implementation.git
cd FEEL-ECG-Implementation

Create and activate a virtual environment:
This isolates the project's dependencies from your system's Python installation.

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

⚙️ How to Run the Pipeline
Execute the scripts in the following order to run the complete pipeline from data preparation to model generation.

1. Preprocess the Data
This script downloads the MIT-BIH dataset into a data/ directory (which is ignored by Git) and generates ecg_segments.npy and ecg_labels.npy.

python preprocess_data.py

2. Create and Compress the Centralized Model
This script trains the model using the three-stage compression pipeline and saves the final feel_ecg_model.tflite file.

python create_compressed_model.py

3. Run the Federated Learning Simulation
This script simulates the MA-FedAvg process with 10 clients and saves the final aggregated model as feel_ecg_federated_model.h5.

python federated_simulation.py

4. Simulate On-Device Inference
This script uses the .tflite model to simulate real-time, QRS-triggered inference. It can be run on your development machine or a target Raspberry Pi.

python run_on_pi.py
