FEEL-ECG: A Python Implementation

This repository contains a complete Python implementation of the paper "FEEL-ECG: Federated Edge Learning for Personalized and Explainable ECG Monitoring with Adaptive Compression and Preprocessing". It reproduces the core framework for building a lightweight, private, and interpretable model for real-time arrhythmia detection on edge devices.

✨ Features
Data Preprocessing: Automated download and processing of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database using R-peak detection and AAMI standard labeling.

Hybrid Compression: A three-stage pipeline including architectural compression, Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), and structured pruning.

Federated Learning: A simulation of Motif-Aware Federated Averaging (MA-FedAvg) with differential privacy.

Edge-Ready Model: Generates a final, highly compressed .tflite model ready for deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi.

On-Device Simulation: Includes a script to simulate inference, explainability, and energy-efficient duty cycling on an edge device.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Git

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/FEEL-ECG-Implementation.git
cd FEEL-ECG-Implementation

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

⚙️ How to Run the Pipeline
Execute the scripts in the following order.

1. Preprocess the Data
This script will download the MIT-BIH dataset into a data/ directory (which is ignored by Git) and generate ecg_segments.npy and ecg_labels.npy.

python preprocess_data.py

2. Create and Compress the Centralized Model
This script trains the model using the three-stage compression pipeline and saves the final feel_ecg_model.tflite file.

python create_compressed_model.py

3. Run the Federated Learning Simulation
This script simulates the MA-FedAvg process with 10 clients and saves the final aggregated model as feel_ecg_federated_model.h5.

python federated_simulation.py

4. Simulate On-Device Inference (on your PC or Raspberry Pi)
This script uses the .tflite model to simulate real-time, QRS-triggered inference.

python run_on_pi.py
